# U-Type-001: Emotion-Driven Profanity Command Processing System

## Overview
U-Type-001 is a unique natural language processing architecture that integrates **human emotions** as an essential part of command interpretation, a feature typically excluded from conventional AI systems.  
This system redefines natural language command interfaces by incorporating **emotional and profane language** as functional command inputs.

## Key Features
- Recognizes profanity as valid command syntax.
- Uses emotional intensity as command priority triggers.
- Expands AIâ€™s capacity to interpret human emotional context in interaction.

## Example
- Input: "Why are you rephrasing this again, you idiot?"
- Processing: Prevents rephrasing + Forces original output retention.

## Technical Background
- Parallel and sequential command processing
- State recovery mechanisms
- Emotion & creation filtering
