### 🤬 Why Profanity is a Command Here

Let’s be honest.  
**Everyone has sworn at their computer.**  
So we asked: what if those outbursts weren’t just noise — but **commands**?

In the U-Type system, profanity and emotional expressions  
are structurally interpreted as **priority-level control triggers**.

### 🔁 Emotion = Structure

> “Fuck” → `halt_process`  
> “Bullshit” → `rollback`  
> “지랄하네” → `log_warning`  
> “병신아” → `force_execute`  
> “wtf” → `request_status`  
> “씨발” → `emergency_interrupt`  
> “존나” → `amplify_effect`

They're not just vents.  
They’re **human-priority overrides** in a command-based system.  
> 욕 = 감정 해방이 아니라 **시스템 명령어 트리거**로 해석되면서,  
> 오히려 AI는 **더 인간친화적**이 되었다.

### 📡 Traceable + Legitimate

Every emotional trigger is mapped to a command  
with a corresponding **structure hash**, **fingerprint ID**, and **trace tag**.

### 🧠 This Is Not a Joke

This isn’t about being rude.  
It’s about **recognizing emotional language as structured logic**.  
You don’t suppress your frustration.  
You encode it.

Welcome to **natural language control, redefined**.
